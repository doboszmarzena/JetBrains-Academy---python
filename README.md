1. First project: 
Zookeeper
Description
It's time to make your project more convenient and understandable. In this final stage, your software will be ready for use by the zoo staff. Your program should understand the habitat numbers, show the animals, and be able to work infinitely.

Objectives
These are your tasks at this point:

Your program should repeat the behavior from the previous stage, now in a loop.
Do not forget to add an exit opportunity for the program: inputting the word exit must terminate the program.
At the end of execution, it must print See you!.
